# Historical-Gradient

This project overlays a historical map of Brooklyn onto a present day map, and includes a slider so you can transition between the two maps.
It also includes markers showing businesses in Downtown Brooklyn that existed in the 1800s, with accompany archival images found in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 
I superimposed the map onto a present day map using NYPL's Map Warper at https://maps.nypl.org/warper/maps/8588, and then used the Mapbox JavaScript library to add markers, a menu, and the opacity slider. 
The code behind the slider and the menu is adapted from Mapbox example code, found at https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/opacity/ and https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/marker-list-click/.
